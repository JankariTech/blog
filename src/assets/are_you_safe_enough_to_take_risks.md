Company values are great, but if they are only saved away in a document they are useless. The values need to be saved in peoples heads and hearts. To achieve that, we discuss them on a regular basis.
Today we had a special guest to lead the discussion: Paurakh Sharma Humagain. He is the first programmer JankariTech ever employed, and even though he left the company a while ago, we stay in a good contact.

For the discussion today he picked the value of “TEAMWORK” and explained how important it is to feel psychologically safe to perform well in a team.

Only a member who feels safe in the team will leave the comfort zone to take on risks. E.g. Tackle a task with the possibility of failure. Taking those risks, helping each other through issues and failures without embarrassing others will take the team to new shores.

A big "THANK YOU" to Paurakh for this new view on teamwork!
