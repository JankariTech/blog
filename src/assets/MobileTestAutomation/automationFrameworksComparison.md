Mobile applications are now an essential part of our daily routines. From shopping and banking to social networking,
there's an app for almost everything. As our reliance on these apps grows, ensuring their quality becomes increasingly
important. This is where mobile test automation frameworks play a key role. They automate the testing process, making
sure apps function correctly without needing manual checks. However, with
numerous [options available](https://www.google.com/search?q=test+automation+frameworks+for+mobile+applications),
